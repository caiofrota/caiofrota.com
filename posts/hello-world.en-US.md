Every programmer’s journey begins with two simple words: **Hello World**.  
It’s the classic first step, a small line of code that opens up an entire universe of possibilities.

This blog isn’t just a portfolio or a list of projects (though you’ll find plenty of that here too). It’s meant to be a place where I can:

- Share insights from the many years working as a software engineer and tech lead.
- Talk about the challenges (and the fun!) of building scalable systems and integrations.
- Publish articles about topics I find interesting, from backend wizardry to the curious little experiments I play with on the side.
- And maybe add a sprinkle of humor and creativity along the way.

A little about me: I’m **Caio**, an engineer at heart, a builder by nature, and someone who’s never stopped being curious. I don’t just write code, I code with **passion, precision, and purpose**.

If you stick around, you’ll get a mix of personal projects, tech deep-dives, and thoughts on this ever-changing world of software. Hopefully, you’ll leave here with something useful, a new perspective, or at least a smile.

So… **Hello World**, and welcome to my space! Let’s start this journey together.
